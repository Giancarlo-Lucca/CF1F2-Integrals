In the repository you will find 3 different .xls files and 3 different folders.

Starting by the files, the first one, called "DSt and SSt analysis.xlsx" present 3 windows, where:
 1 - F1_F2 analysis: Is the equivalent of Table II of the paper.  
 2 - Rank F1_F2: We selected and sorted the obtained DSt and SSt of the last window.
 3 - Possible Pairs: It presents all the possible combinations of this study. Considering combinations with a High, Medium and Low F2. The resultant of this combinations is available in the folders.
 
The second file "F1_F2(summary) (Table VI).xlsx" is related, obviously, with Table VI of the paper. In it, the obtained accuracy of all combinations of CF1_F2-integrals are summarized. This value is the same used in the files "AllSeeds", presented in each folder.

The last file "BestCF1F2 vs. Classicals (Table VII).xlsx", present the comparisons of the best achieved CF1_F2-integral (FGL-Min) against state-of-the-art fuzzy classifiers and non-averaging operators.

For each folder present in this repository, we have 3 sub-folders 26871710, 53743421 and 80615130. These values are related to the considered seed to the execution. Then, for each folder we present the results obtained by the different CF1_F2-integrals. Furthermore, we summarize the results of all seeds in the file tagged as (AllSeeds).
